django-fhir
===========

This software is in the very begining phases now. It is not ready for prime time at all. That said, here ishow to install it.

(working on compatibility with MongoDb and a pluggable backend 
eg. to use back-end HAPI-FHIR Server via API calls)

To install type the following in a shell:

    git clone https://github.com/videntity/django-fhir.git
    pip install ./django-fhir
    

Add "fhir" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'fhir',
    )

Include the direct URLconf in your project urls.py like this:

    url(r'^fhir/', include('fhir.urls')),


Create your database tables.


    python manage.py syncdb

Support a couple resource types by adding them in the admin or 
using the following command to activate `Practitioner` and `Organization`.


    python manage.py loaddata [your download path]/django-fhir/fhir/fixtures/provider-directory-resources.json


Use the APIs. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/fhir/hello to verify the installation.
   
UPDATE: SupportedResourceType model has been extended to allow FHIR Transaction Types for a 
given resource to be permitted or denied. ie. Allow Patient resource to be searched but
update or Delete can be denied. Each FHIR Transaction mode is a BooleanField in the database.
SupportedResourceType.access_denied("field_name") or 
SupportedResourceType.access_permitted("field_name") will return a True or False value

example usage:

        try:
        rt = SupportedResourceType.objects.get(resource_name=resource_type)
        if rt.access_denied(access_to_check="fhir_delete"):
            msg = "%s access denied to %s records on this FHIR server." % ("DELETE",
                                                                           resource_type)
            return kickout_403(msg)
